## Project Overview
• Created a model that predicts the score (in terms of range) of IPL matches<br/>
• Optimized Multiple-Linear, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and AdaBoost regression models 

## How will this project help?
• This project is for the fantasy cricket fans out there, helping them to earn extra fantasy points for Dream11 IPL 2020

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
• **Removing unwanted columns**<br/>
• **Keeping only consistent teams**<br/>
• **Removing the first 5 overs data in every match**<br/>
• **Converting the column 'date' from string into datetime object**<br/>
• **Handling categorical features**

## Model Building and Evaluation
Evaluation metric: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)<br/>
• Linear Regression - 15.843 <br/>
• Decision Tree - 22.78<br/>
• Random Forest - 18.20<br/>
• **Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) - 15.79**

• This repository consists of files required to deploy a ___Machine Learning Web App___ created with ___Flask___ on ___Heroku___ platform.
